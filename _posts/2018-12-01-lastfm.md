For my non-written element that I've created/remixed, I'd like to talk about a personal project of mine: [last.fm-spelunker](https://github.com/sumeet-bansal/last.fm-spelunker).

## Context
In its simplest form, [last.fm](https://www.last.fm) is a service that records your listening history. I've had my Spotify account linked to last.fm for the past couple years, and [my last.fm account](https://www.last.fm/user/sbansal21) keeps a history of everything I've listened to on Spotify since I created the account in early 2017. For example, if I wanted to look up what I listened to on my birthday, I could easily check my history for March 21:

![last.fm recent tracks](https://github.com/culture-quantified/culture-quantified.github.io/raw/master/assets/images/march21.png)

When I first came up with the idea for last.fm-spelunker, I was unfamiliar with the Python and SQL programming languages and wanted to learn more about both by creating a data science project. I realized I had this great dataset from my last.fm history and decided to create visualizations of my listening history.

## `scraper.py`
The first step to working with this dataset was downloading it into a SQL database. Since last.fm didn't (and still doesn't) have a user-friendly way to download an account's history, I had to do this programmatically using last.fm's API (Application Program Interface), which is a way for more tech-savvy users to access the internal data of last.fm using Python code:
```python
with dataset.connect('sqlite:///last-fm.db') as db:
	resp = requests.get(self.RECENT_URL % (1, self.PER_PAGE)).json()
	TOTAL_PAGES = int(resp['recenttracks']['@attr']['totalPages'])
	for page in reversed(range(1, TOTAL_PAGES + 1)):
		scrobbles = requests.get(self.RECENT_URL % (page, self.PER_PAGE)).json()['recenttracks']['track']
		scrobbles = map(lambda x : process_scrobble(x), scrobbles)
		db[self.USER].insert(scrobbles)
```
The actual code can be found in a file called `scraper.py` [here](https://github.com/sumeet-bansal/last.fm-spelunker/blob/master/scraper.py) and is actually several hundred lines, but this is a (very) simplified snippet of code that creates a local database of my listening history through the last.fm API.

## `scrubber.py`
Now that I had the local database, I could finally start to actually work with the data. But, before I could do so, I had to clean up the data. Because some albums could be titled as *Album Title (Explicit Version)* or other such variations of the real album title, it was difficult to get reliable statistics about my data. For example, if I wanted to see how many times I had listened to an album, e.g. [*The College Dropout*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_College_Dropout), I'd have to check both *The College Dropout* and *The College Dropout (Explicit)*. Or, if an artist had used a different name in the past, my listening history for that artist would be split across two different names (e.g. K Dot changed his name to Kendrick Lamar). To clean the data and avoid any such issues, I first renamed all album titles with variations such as "(Explicit)" or "(Remastered)" appended at the end of the album title using Python code as shown below.
```python
with dataset.connect('sqlite:///last-fm.db') as db:
	sql = 'SELECT DISTINCT album FROM %s' % username
	albums = [str(row['album']).replace("'", "\\'") for row in db.query(sql)]
	versions = [' (Explicit)', ' (Explicit Version)', ' (Edited)', ' (Remastered)']
	valid, standalone = {}, {}
	standalone = {}

	for album in albums:
		altnames = [album + version for version in versions]
		for altname in altnames:
			if altname in albums:
				if album not in valid:
					valid[album] = []
				valid[album].append(altname)
				albums[:] = [copy for copy in albums if copy != album]
	for album in albums:
		for version in versions:
			base = album[:-len(version)]
			if version in album and base not in valid:
				standalone[album.replace('\'', '\'\'')] = version

	for album in valid:
		for alt in valid[album]:
			sql = 'UPDATE %s SET album = \'%s\' WHERE album = \'%s\'' % (username, album, alt)
			db.query(sql)

	for album in standalone:
		sql = 'UPDATE %s SET album = \'%s\' WHERE album = \'%s\'' % (username, album[:-len(standalone[album])], album)
		db.query(sql)
```
The full code for this can be found in `scrubber.py` [here](https://github.com/sumeet-bansal/last.fm-spelunker/blob/master/scrubber.py). Then, I manually renamed all other incorrect names using a SQL script that can be found [here](https://github.com/sumeet-bansal/last.fm-spelunker/blob/master/scrub.sql). Below is a snippet of this SQL script.
```sql
UPDATE sbansal21 SET artist = 'Anderson .Paak' WHERE artist LIKE 'Anderson%Paak%' OR album = 'The Anderson .Paak EP';
UPDATE sbansal21 SET album = 'Malibu' WHERE album = 'MALIBU';
UPDATE sbansal21 SET album = 'Robots - EP' WHERE artist = 'EarthGang' AND track IN ('Flickted', 'So Many Feelings', 'Underwater (feat. Sir)', 'Robots', 'Artificial', 'Lyfted Intro');
UPDATE sbansal21 SET album = 'Charlie Eastern' WHERE artist = 'Jalen Santoy' AND track = 'Foreplay';
UPDATE sbansal21 SET artist = 'Jay IDK' WHERE artist = 'Jay idk';
UPDATE sbansal21 SET track = 'Pick Up the Phone (feat. Quavo)', album = 'Jeffery' WHERE track LIKE 'Pick Up the Phone%';
UPDATE sbansal21 SET album = 'Jeffery' WHERE artist = 'Young Thug' AND album = 'No, My track is JEFFERY';
```
Finally, the data was pre-processed and cleaned.

## `spelunker.py`
Now that the data was clean and ready for visualization, I had to decide what to do with it. I discovered an interesting statistical visualization called a [streamgraph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streamgraph), which is essentially a [stacked area graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_chart) displaced around a central axis, resulting in a flowing, organic shape.

To create this visualization, I used the popular [D3.js data visualization library](https://d3js.org/), which is written in JavaScript, another language I wanted to become more familiar with and used [this code](http://bl.ocks.org/WillTurman/4631136) as a starting point. I first processed my listening history as necessary to get the data for the streamgraph and then used D3.js to graph this data in a web-based streamgraph using a mix of Python and HTML/JS/CSS code that can be found [here](https://github.com/sumeet-bansal/last.fm-spelunker/tree/master/scrobble-streamgraph).

Example screenshots and videos of the resulting streamgraphs can be found below.
