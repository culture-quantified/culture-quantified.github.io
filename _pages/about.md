My name's Sumeet and I'm a Bay Area native in my third year of studying computer science and mathematics at [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/). Culture Quantified is my CAT 125 website for Fall 2018.

"Algorithms" and "big data" can seem very abstract to people who haven't studied them, but they affect our lives in very real and concrete ways. The goal of this website is to demystify these concepts by analyzing them in the context of modern culture and at a high level: how Spotify has used algorithmic music curation to cement itself as a cultural fixture, [how Facebook collects user data to tailor ads](https://culture-quantified.github.io/2018-11-13/facebook), etc.

As participants of society, we consume culture, actively or passively. Our environment is characterized by music streaming, social media, sports and entertainment (e.g. Hollywood). These aspects of culture surround us and become unavoidable, but also give us a common understanding: we all know what [Apple Music](https://www.apple.com/music/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/) are, who [LeBron James](http://www.lebronjames.com/) and [Kanye West](http://www.kanyewest.com/) are. And so, we can use these common cultural understandings as vehicles through which we can learn about more abstract concepts like [collaborative filtering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaborative_filtering) (how [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/) recommends products based on what similar users buy).

The audience for this website is anyone familiar with modern culture&mdash;understanding data science at Spotify requires a basic understanding of streaming (as an example)&mdash;and interested in (or curious about) algorithms and data.
