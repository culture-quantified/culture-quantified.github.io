My name's Sumeet and I'm a Bay Area native in my third year of studying computer science and mathematics at [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/). Culture Quantified is my CAT 125 website for Fall 2018.

"Algorithms" and "big data" can seem very abstract to people who haven't studied them, but they affect our lives in very real and concrete ways. The goal of this website is to demystify these concepts by analyzing them in the context of modern culture and at a high level: how Spotify has used algorithmic music curation to cement itself as a cultural fixture, [how Facebook collects user data to tailor ads](https://culture-quantified.github.io/2018-11-13/facebook), etc.

The audience for this website is anyone familiar with modern culture&mdash;understanding data science at Spotify requires a basic understanding of streaming (as an example)&mdash;and interested in algorithms and data.
